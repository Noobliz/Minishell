#include <stdio.h>

	char *new_line = readline("write here > ");
	while (!new_line || !new_line[0])
	{
		if (new_line)
			free(new_line);
		new_line = readline("write here > ");
	}
	printf("here the string given :: %s !", new_line);
	add_history(new_line);
	free(new_line);
	new_line = readline("write here > ");
	while (!new_line || !new_line[0])
	{
		if (new_line)
			free(new_line);
		new_line = readline("write here > ");
	}
	printf("here the string given :: %s !", new_line);
	add_history(new_line);
	free(new_line);
	printf("check your history !");
