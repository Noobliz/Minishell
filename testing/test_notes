same problem here on school computer :: undefined reference to readline :: even with what I assu;e to be the right libraries since no error on including those at all. will look it up to find more and get back to testing

you need to compile with the "flag" : -lreadline, it should work this way. At least for me it does

point of this testing ground == trying export and unset in a separate, small unit, with our own env variable.
