 #include <signal.h>

       typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int);

       sighandler_t signal(int signum, sighandler_t handler);

signal() sets the disposition of the signal signum to handler, which is
       either SIG_IGN (ignore signal), SIG_DFL (default action), or the address of a  programmer-defined  func‚Äê
       tion (a "signal handler").

# Because the man recommand to not use signal(), let's focus en sigaction instead. (diff :Signal is simpler and sigaction stronger and more malleable)

NAME
       sigaction, rt_sigaction - examine and change a signal action

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       int sigaction(int signum, const struct sigaction *act,
                     struct sigaction *oldact);

 The  sigaction() system call is used to change the action taken by a process on receipt
       of a specific signal.

       signum specifies the signal and can be any valid signal except SIGKILL and SIGSTOP (because those signals can't be captured).

      act : A pointer to a structure sigaction that dertermines how to handle the signal (and more).
      oldact : A pointer to an other struct sigaction where the previous behavior (ex: what function is called to handle the signal) was stored
      
       If act is non-NULL, the new action for signal signum is installed from act.  If  oldact
       is non-NULL, the previous action is saved in oldact.
       
 The sigaction structure:

           struct sigaction {
               void     (*sa_handler)(int);
               void     (*sa_sigaction)(int, siginfo_t *, void *);
               sigset_t   sa_mask;
               int        sa_flags;
               void     (*sa_restorer)(void); # is not intended for application use.
           };

sa_handler : Function to call when a signal is captured. It's parameter is the signal number.
sa_sigaction : Alternative to sa_handler, more advanced because allows to take an extra context. #But I don't understand what context exactly
sa_mask : A mask of signals to block. For example if we want to block specific signal while an other one is being handle.
sa_flags : To add options #looks important, need to do more research
#------------------USEFUL SA_FLAGS---------------------------------
SA_RESTART	restart syscalls that were interrupted by a signal, for example readline interrupted by ctrl+C.
SA_SIGINFO	Use sa_sigaction instead of sa_handler to get more infos.
SA_NOCLDWAIT	avoid zombi process (useful for SIGCHLD).
SA_NODEFER	Allows a signal to be received various times.
SA_RESETHAND	Reinitialise the behavior of a signal to default after having being handled once.
SA_NOCLDSTOP	Ignore SIGCHLD when a child process is stopped (instead of being terminated).

limitations:
avoid using functions like printf or malloc in a signal handler to not create "race conditions". Basically functions that use buffers or shared resources.
